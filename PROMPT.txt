Write a Python program using the `curses` library to implement a Snake game with the following specifications:

1. The game should have a fixed size of 20x40.
2. The snake starts as "red" and grows to spell out "redhat" as it consumes food.
3. The food represents the next character in the sequence, starting after "red".
4. The game is won when the snake spells out "redhat", and the winning message should display "Red Hat OpenShift !!".
5. If the snake collides with itself or the game boundaries, the game ends with a "Game Over" message.
6. When the snake is moving right, the letters should flip so that the first letter appears last. For other directions, the letters should remain in their natural order.
7. The python file should be "snake.py"
8. The food should never be right next to boundary
